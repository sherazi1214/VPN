## VPN (Virtual Private Network) — Explained Simply
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a remote server over the internet. It helps you:

Hide your IP address

Encrypt your online activity

Bypass geo-restrictions or censorship

Secure data over public Wi-Fi

## How VPN Works
You connect to a VPN server.

Your data is encrypted before leaving your device.

It travels through an encrypted tunnel to the VPN server.

The VPN server forwards your request to the internet.

The reply comes back to the VPN server, then encrypted and sent back to you.

Your real IP is hidden, and your data is secure.


## Common Uses of VPN

Privacy	Hides browsing from ISPs, trackers, or government.
Public Wi-Fi Protection	Secures your data on coffee shop or airport Wi-Fi.
Bypass Geo-blocks	Access Netflix US in another country, etc.
Remote Access	Connect to a work network securely from anywhere.
Avoid Censorship	Access blocked websites in restricted countries.

## VPN Protocols

OpenVPN	Most common, secure and open source.
IKEv2/IPSec	Fast, stable for mobile users.
WireGuard	New, very fast and secure.
L2TP/IPSec	Older, decent but slower.
PPTP	Very old and insecure, avoid if possible.

## How to Use a VPN
Install a VPN app (e.g., NordVPN, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN).

Log in and choose a server location (e.g., US, UK).

Click Connect — now your traffic is encrypted.

You can also manually set up VPNs in Windows, macOS, Linux, or mobile devices.
